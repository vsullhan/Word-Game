    <div class = "helpText">In order to start a game, you need to click one of these buttons:</div>
    
    <div id="gameModesBox">
        <input type="submit" id="SPMode1Button" value="Hot  Potato">
        <input type="submit" id="SPMode2Button" value="Survival">
        <input type="submit" id="MPMode1Button" value="Multiplayer">

    </div>
 
    <div class = "helpText">There are two single player modes. In the first mode, you have ten rounds to guess 
        a word from a given substring in as little time as possible, the less time you take to get a word, the more 
        points you get. In the second mode, you keep playing until you are unable to guess a word. Once you fail to 
        guess a word in the given amount of time, the game ends.
    </div>

    <div class = "helpText">After you click one of the above buttons, you will be asked to select a difficulty. 
        In Easy mode, you get 10 seconds to guess a word containing a two letter long substring. In Medium mode, 
        you are given 7.5 seconds to guess a word containing a three letter long substring. In Hard mode, you 
        get 5 seconds to guess a word containing a four letter long substring
    </div>

    <div class = "helpText">Once you start the game, you will see the amount of time you have remaining, your 
        current score/round, and the substring, as well as this:
    </div>

    <div id = "inputSection">
        <label for = "wordInput">Enter  a  word  containing  the  substring: </label>
        <input id = "wordInput" name = "wordInput" type = "text">
        <input id = "submitWord" type = "submit" value = "Enter">
    </div>

    <div class = "helpText">Type your guess into the input section and hit the enter button on your keyboard 
        Once you have your guess. If your guess is not a word, you will be told so and the timer will keep 
        going down.
    </div>

    <div class = "helpText">Once the game is over, you will be directed to the game over page, from which you 
        can get back to the home page.
